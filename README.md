# thomasverlinde's blog about fastai learning
## goal: Learn deep learning and machine learning
As somebody who studied bio-science engineer in KU Leuven, Belgium. It seems very interesting to me to follow Jeremy Howard's course on machine learning. I have been through the part 1 (although only once), through some of the walkthrough up until 6 because I do not know how to work in Gradio (the free servers seem to be occupied all the time) and I am currently going to the fastbook. I am surprised by the ease with which it is possible to work in jupyter lab. I have never worked in it during my time in uni. 

This commit is made using vim. I used the commands "git clone <file>","git add <file>", "git commit <file>" and "$ <repository> git push" to make the changes out of my terminal.
